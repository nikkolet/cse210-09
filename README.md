**Cycle Game**

Welcome to the Cycle game!  The game is very simple.  There are 2 players who will try to trap each other while not getting trapped or trapping theirselves.  The player that runs into a tail, whether their own or the opposing player, loses.  Think quick, be smart and don't get trapped and run into a wall.

Getting Started
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

cse210-09/cycle/__main__.py
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select the main.py file inside the cse210-09/rider folder and click the "run" icon.
